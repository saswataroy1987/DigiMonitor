# DigiMonitor
Digimonitor is a cyberSpace Monitoring tool that uses supervised and unsupervised techniques on social media data like Twitter and Facebook. It is an integrated Real Time DigiMonitor framework which performs three major tasks in parallel. Data Collection (Task I): Continuously crawling relevant tweets and classify the tweets before storing them in database (MongoDB). Identification of important events (Task II): Continuously monitoring the tweets (last 7 days) for detecting major events dynamically. Virality Prediction (Task III): Continuously monitor the tweets and predict whether any of these tweets would become viral.
